# In an undirected graph, the degree d(u) of a vertex u is the number of neighbors u
# has, or equivalently, the number of edges incident upon it.

# Given: A simple graph with n â‰¤ 103 vertices in the edge list format.

# Return: An array D[1..n] where D[i] is the degree of vertex i.

# See Figure 3 for visual example from the sample dataset.
